    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This apple cider recipe is super easy to make. I used to buy the spices already mixed at the grocery store, and
        they stopped carrying them, so I just made my own. Great for a shower or get-together, and the slow cooker keeps
        it warm so guests can enjoy it through the night! Serve with a slice of orange, and add spiced rum, if desired.
    </p>

        <li>1 (64 fluid ounce) bottle apple cider</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon whole cloves</li>
        <li>â…“ cup brown sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine apple cider and cinnamon sticks in a slow cooker.</li>
